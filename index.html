    React Native is a computer code which is more like JavaScript and HTML together.
    React primitives render to native platform UI, meaning your app uses the same n
    ative platform APIs other apps do.

Many platforms, one React. Create platform-specific versions of components 
so a single codebase can share code across platforms. With React Native, one 
team can maintain two platforms and share a common technology—React.<br>
React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs
 via React’s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript. This enables native a
 pp development for whole new teams of developers, and can let existing nat
 ive teams work much faster.
